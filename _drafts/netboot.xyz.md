Once upon a time rackspace had a project that was a ipxe bootloader that chained you into all sorts of distros:

[rackerlabs.github.io/boot.rackspace.com](http://rackerlabs.github.io/boot.rackspace.com/)

That project is no longer maintained and there is a link to [netboot.xyz](https://netboot.xyz/).
